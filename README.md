Udemy Clone – Built with HTML, Basic CSS, and Simple Animations:

This project is a simple Udemy clone developed using HTML and CSS. The goal of this project was to replicate the core design and layout of Udemy, focusing on the homepage, course cards, and other key sections.

Key Features:
Clean and Responsive Layout: The site is designed with a clean, minimalistic layout to closely mimic Udemy’s original interface. It includes sections for featured courses, categories, and instructor profiles.
Course Cards: Each course is displayed in a card format, showing essential details like the course title, image, rating, and pricing.
Basic CSS Styling: The design uses fundamental CSS techniques for styling, including flexbox for layout and media queries for responsiveness.
Animation Effects:
To add more interactivity and user engagement, I've included simple CSS animations:

Hover Effects on Buttons: When hovering over the buttons like "Enroll Now," the background color changes smoothly, and the button scales slightly to make it more interactive.
Slide-in Course Cards: As you scroll down the page, the course cards gently slide in from the right, giving a dynamic feel to the content display.
Image Hover Zoom: Course images zoom slightly with a subtle shadow when hovered over, giving emphasis to the course.
Smooth Page Transitions: Different sections of the page transition smoothly with a fade-in effect, making navigation seamless.
Sticky Header: The header sticks to the top when scrolling, with a slight shadow effect when activated, ensuring easy access to navigation.
This project is a great example of using basic web development techniques to build an engaging, responsive, and user-friendly interface.
